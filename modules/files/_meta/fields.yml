        - name: fuid
          description: >

        - name: tx_hosts

        - name: conn_uids
          description: >
            Connection UIDs over which the file was transferred.
        - name: source
          description: >
            An identification of the source of the file data.  E.g. it may be a network protocol over which it was transferred, or a local file path which was read, or some other input source.
        - name: depth
          description: >
            A value to represent the depth of this file in relation to its source.  In SMTP, it is the depth of the MIME attachment on the message.  In HTTP, it is the depth of the request within the TCP connection.

          description: >
            A set of analysis types done during the file analysis.

          description: >
            A mime type provided by the strongest file magic signature match against the bof_buffer field of fa_file, or in the cases where no buffering of the beginning of file occurs, an initial guess of the mime type based on the first data seen.
        - name: filename
          description: >

        - name: overflow_bytes
          description: >
            The number of bytes in the file stream that were not delivered to stream file analyzers.  This could be overlapping bytes or bytes that couldnt be reassembled.

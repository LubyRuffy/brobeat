            This can indicate that this software being detected should definitely be sent onward to the logging framework.  By default, only software that is interesting due to a change in version or it being currently unknown is sent to the logging framework.  This can be set to T to force the record to be sent to the logging framework if some amount of this tracking needs to happen in a specific way to the software.
